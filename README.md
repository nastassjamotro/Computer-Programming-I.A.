### Project for IB Computer Science IA 2018: a pacman game

**General Description of Pacman**
- In this game, the player navigates Pac-Man through this maze which contains dots all throughout. The goal
of the game is to collect all the dots. However, while the player is moving Pac-Man around the screen to collect
all the dots, four (sometimes five) ghosts roam the maze trying to kill Pac-Man. If any of the ghosts hit Pac-Man,
he loses a life; when all lives have been lost, it's game over.
