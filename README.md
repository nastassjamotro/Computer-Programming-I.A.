**General Description of Pacman**
- In this game, the player navigates Pac-Man through this maze which contains dots all throughout. The goal
of the game is to collect all the dots. However, while the player is moving Pac-Man around the screen to collect
all the dots, four (sometimes five) ghosts roam the maze trying to kill Pac-Man. If any of the ghosts hit Pac-Man,
he loses a life; when all lives have been lost, it's game over.
- Most Pac-Man games also have four larger, flashing dots known as Power Pellets that provide Pac-Man with the
temporary ability to eat the ghosts and earn bonus points, though this is only for a very short period of time.

##### The classic or any form of the Pac-Man game can be found with just a simple web search. Because of this, I decided that I wanted to try my hand at creating my own version of this game and see what appears to be a simple game, really entails.
