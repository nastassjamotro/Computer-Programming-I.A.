### Project for IB Computer Science IA 2018: a pacman game
**General Description of Pacman**
- In this game, the player navigates Pac-Man through this maze which contains dots all throughout. The goal
of the game is to collect all the dots. However, while the player is moving Pac-Man around the screen to collect
all the dots, four (sometimes five) ghosts roam the maze trying to kill Pac-Man. If any of the ghosts hit Pac-Man,
he loses a life; when all lives have been lost, it's game over.
- Most Pac-Man games also have four larger, flashing dots known as Power Pellets that provide Pac-Man with the
temporary ability to eat the ghosts and earn bonus points, though this is only for a very short period of time.
##### The classic or any form of the Pac-Man game can be found with just a simple web search. Because of this, I decided that I wanted to try my hand at creating my own version of this game and see what appears to be a simple game, really entails.
### My Pac-Man Game Version:
- The Pac-Man game that I created used the arrow keys to move Pac-Man around just like any game can be found to do.
- The ghosts are programmed to move in as much of a random movement as I could make, but they do not follow Pac-Man 
like the online version does when they get close to Pac-Man.
- I also don't have power pellets in my version of the game, so Pac-Man simply just moves around the maze collecting
the dots and gaining points while having to avoid the ghosts.
- My code, while it doesn't include power pellets and Pac-Man's ability to eat the ghosts for bonus points, still has
three lives to Pac-Man as well as the animation action of Pac-Man opening and closing his mouth. So it isn't all that bland.
